# Single_residue_rotation

Functions for rotating a single amino acid, either in a dipeptide or in the context of the protein. The main function is run_single_residue().

run_single_residue(PDB_name1, which_res,folder_name, save_folder, is_dipeptide)\
## Input:
PDB_name1: the name of the PDB to be run. Should be saved as XXXX_H.pdb or XXXX.mat where PDB_name1 = XXXX\
which_res: the residue ID\
folder_name: The full path name to the folder containing the PDB file.\
save_folder: Folder to save results to \
is_dipeptide: 1 to run just the dipeptide, 0 to run in context of the protein

## Notes:
Create PDB file with hydrogens by using download_preprocess_pdb.py which also adds the hydrogen atoms to the protein\
Final results are stored in \*protein_single_rotation_minE.mat or \*dipeptide_single_rotation_minE.mat
